# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
- - In the `final_practice.md` excercise I was able to make an if statement with several respoonses based on the conditions of the arguments This was the most challenging excercise and it was a helpful excercise because of that fact
- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
- - Methods can analyze, modify, add and delete data from our programs, the naming convention for methods specifices we should name custom methods as verbs, this makes sense because methods make things actually happen and change in our code, like verbs!
